## LIBRARIES USED

### Matplotlib
It  is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.
One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows  visual access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.

### Python Numpy
NumpyÂ is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Besides its obvious scientific uses, Numpy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data

### Tkinter
Tkinter is the python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is the most commonly used GUI toolkit. This module provides a number of functions that you can use to display  appropriate messages and text boxes, and create buttons.  It provides a convenient, volatile and user friendly method  to input data into a program, which can later be for various purposes. Once the main window is created, any number of widgets can be inserted into it.

### MYSQL Connector
It is a library used to connect to a MySQL database from a python script. This is useful in cases which require storage of large amounts of data in a program. By establishing a connection and creating connection objects and cursor objects, one can traverse data present in a database and fetch the required data to be used in the program. it provides an efficient method of data manipulation.
