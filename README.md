## LIBRARIES USED

### Matplotlib
It  is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.
One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows  visual access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.

### Python Numpy
NumpyÂ is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Besides its obvious scientific uses, Numpy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data

### Tkinter
Tkinter is the python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is the most commonly used GUI toolkit. This module provides a number of functions that you can use to display  appropriate messages and text boxes, and create buttons.  It provides a convenient, volatile and user friendly method  to input data into a program, which can later be for various purposes. Once the main window is created, any number of widgets can be inserted into it.

### MYSQL Connector
It is a library used to connect to a MySQL database from a python script. This is useful in cases which require storage of large amounts of data in a program. By establishing a connection and creating connection objects and cursor objects, one can traverse data present in a database and fetch the required data to be used in the program. it provides an efficient method of data manipulation.

## WORKING DESCRIPTION
<p>
The program begins by opening the main window,  where the user can either register as a new user or log in. Buttons created using Tkinter are used for this purpose. When a new user registers, they are taken to a new window where they are asked to input data into text boxes, which is later fetched. a file is created for each new user using the os module, which saves their password and username, After this, all of the fetched data  is stored in a database, for which the connection is established is using MySQL connector library. If a user is logging in, their password is first confirmed using the file, after which a log is made onto a table in the database recording the username, date, time and login status.
</p>
<p>
  <div>
After logging in, they are taken to a new window where they are given 3 options to choose from- lines, conics or trigonometry. buttons for these were created using Tkinter, using the Button() function and upon clicking them are taken to the respective windows.
    </div>
    <div>
The windows for straight lines and conics contain text boxes, where the user inputs the values of the constants in the mathematical equations of the curve into text boxes made using Tkinter and the values were fetched using get()function, assigned variables. (Separate functions were made for plotting for making the code more compact). The windows finally contain two buttons- calculate and back to homescreen. upon clicking on calculate, the variables are plotted using pyplot and a new window displays the graph of the given equation. On clicking back to homescreen, it deletes the current window by using the destroy() function and takes you back to the original window.
For TrigoFunctions, buttons were created for all the trigonometric functions. Upon clicking any of them, the graph for the function is plotted using pyplot directly and requires no further input.
  </div>
  <div>
    <b> In both the cases multiple graphs can be plotted in the same window. </b>
  </div>
</p>
<p>
We used mysql.connector and MySQL to store information in a database. a connector object was created, and two tables were created in the database. One table was used to store the data regarding the registration of users, i.e, their username, password, date of  birth, gender and age
the other table is used to store the data about the users logging in. After the user enters the username and password into the text boxes and they are confirmed to be registered users, it makes a record on the table LOGIN_INFO. here their username, the exact date and time when they logged in and their login status is recorded. to store the date and time, the datetime module was used to get an accurate value.
all of the inputs entered into the text boxes are fetched using get() and stored in variables. the variables are stored into the table using a cursor object when the register button is clicked.
